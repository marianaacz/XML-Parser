/* Reflection:
 This project was honestly a pain. I should've started way before than I did. I thought it wasn't going to be this hard
 It wasn't hard to understand the logic but it was hard to implement it in the correct form. I had a bunch of little errors
 I did fix most of them but I still think this project needs a little bit more work for it to be perfect.
 I did learn a ton, this project was complex but I think overall I learned a ton of things that will help in the future.
